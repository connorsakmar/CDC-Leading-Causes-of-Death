# CDC Leading Causes of Death in the United States from 1999-2016


Americans keep dying from the leading causes of death every year, but has there been any progress in slowing the rate of deaths? This project delves into the leading causes of death from 1999-2016 in the United States using data sourced from https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu. To observe both geographic and yearly trends in deaths, three visuals were created to represent the data: a map, a bar graph, and a scatter plot. By looking at all three, we can determine just how many Americans are dying from these causes, which causes are killing them, and if these 



Millions of Americans die each year and the leading causes of death account for a large portion of mortality. While heart disease and cancer seem to dominate the news, it is hard for people to visualize the numbers that are often thrown at them. Additionally, this app seeks to place common death statistics in perspective. While, yes, more people died from cancer this year than they did last year, factors such as age and population size need to be considered. The main purpose of the shiny app is to provide an informative and straightforward representation of data on the leading causes of death to not only inform the common American citizen, but to also pique the interest of people who want to research the topic further.



By informing the common American about the leading causes of death in the United States, the hope is that more people will realize that there remains a high demand for research and support for preventative measures. If the shiny app can aid that effort in any capacity, then it should be considered a success. With this increased interest, hopefully Americans will be able to decrease the amount of deaths due to the leading causes.
