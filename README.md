# CDC Leading Causes of Death in the United States from 1999-2016


Americans are dying and modern science can't keep up. I look into the leading causes of death from 1999-2016 in the United States using data sourced from https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu. To observe both geographic and yearly trends in deaths, I create three plots to represent the data: a map, a bar graph, and a scatter plot. By looking at all three graphs, we can determine just how many Americans are dying from these causes, and what exactly is killing them.



Millions of Americans die each year and the leading causes of death account for a large portion of mortality. While heart disease and cancer seem to dominate the news, it is hard for people to visualize the numbers that are often thrown at them. The main purpose of the shiny app is to provide an informative and straightforward representation of data on leading death causes not only to inform the common American citizen, but to also pique the interest of people who want to research the topic further.



By informing the common American about the leading causes of death in the United States, I hope that more people will realize that there remains a high demand for research and support for preventative measures. If the shiny app can aid that effort in any capacity, then it should be considered a success. With this increased interest, hopefully Americans will be able to decrease the amount of deaths due to the leading causes.
