# CDC Leading Causes of Death in the United States from 1999-2016


Americans keep dying and modern science can't keep up. I look into the leading causes of death from 1999-2016 to observe both geographic and yearly trends in deaths. I do this by creating three plots to represent this data: a map, a bar graph, and a scatter plot. By looking at all three graphs, we can determine just how quickly, and how many, Americans are dying to these causes. 

The data was obtained from here:
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu

Millions of Americans die each year and the leading causes of death account for a large portion of them. While heart disease and cancer seem to dominate the news, it is hard for people to visualize the numbers that are often thrown at them. The main purpose of the shiny app is to provide an informative and straight forward representation of leading deaths data that can not only inform the common American citizen, but may also pique the interest of people who want to research the topic further. 

By educating and informing the common American about the leading deaths data, the hope is that more people will realize that there is still a high demand for research and support to prevent these deaths. If the shiny app can aid in anyway in that effort, then it should be considered a success. With this increased interest, hopefully Americans will be able to lower the amount of deaths due to the leading causes.
